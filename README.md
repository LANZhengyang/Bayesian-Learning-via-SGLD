# Bayesian-Learning-via-SGLD

Implementation of the algorithm in the paper [Bayesian Learning via Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/research/compstats/WelTeh2011a.pdf).
You can find my report [here](https://github.com/LANZhengyang/Bayesian-Learning-via-SGLD/blob/main/report.pdf)

## Installation and Usage
For read only: you can just click to jump to the notebook and read them online.

For run and modify:

1) Run on Colab:(recommend)
Click the Colab button in the top of each notebook.

2) Run locally
It requires python >= 3.6 and git. 
Recommend to install packages in a virtual environment.

First clone the project
```
$ sudo install git
$ git clone https://github.com/LANZhengyang/Bayesian-Learning-via-SGLD.git

$ pip install numpy seaborn matplotlib pandas torch notebook
$ jupyter notebook
```

It will open jupyter notebook in your default browser then you can open the notebook and try to run it directly or change the hyperparameter and see the result.
